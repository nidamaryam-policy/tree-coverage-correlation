This Google Earth Engine (GEE) script calculates the Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($R$) to analyze the relationship between vegetation cover (NDVI), surface temperature (LST), and air quality (AOD) within the Pune district boundary during 2019.

The core goal is to statistically verify the mitigating effects of green spaces (NDVI) on the Urban Heat Island effect (LST) and air pollution (AOD).

Study Area: Pune Administrative District, India (defined using the FAO/GAUL/2015/level2 dataset).
Timeframe: January 1, 2019, to January 1, 2020.
